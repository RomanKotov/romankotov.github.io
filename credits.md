I want to say thanks for help building this site to:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for nice and fast experience for getting started.
- [Github](https://github.com) for hosting a site, as well as a source code for it.
- [Jekyll minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) as a basis for this site.
-  [Blog entry](https://www.bytedude.com/jekyll-syntax-highlighting-and-line-numbers/) of Marcin swieczkowski about syntax highlighting. And also his [repository](https://github.com/m-cat/bytedude.com/blob/master/_sass/minutia/_syntax-highlighting.scss) as a source of inspiration. I am also grateful for his [syntax highlighting theme](https://github.com/m-cat/nimbus-pygments).
- [Noir Jekyll theme](https://noir.essentialenemy.com/) for another part of inspiration about syntax highlighting.
- [Github action for deploying a custom jekyll site](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jekyll-4-build-deploy). It has helped to configure my own action after some trials.
- [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) for helping to setup a comments system for the site.
- A [post of Travis Downs](https://travisdowns.github.io/blog/2020/02/05/now-with-comments.html) and also [post of Willy McAllister](https://spinningnumbers.org/a/staticman-heroku.html) for setting up a comments.
